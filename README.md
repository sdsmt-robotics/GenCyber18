# GenCyber 2018

Welcome to the Robotics course for the 2018 GenCyber Camp!
In this repository you will find all the code you need for the class.
Remington and I will add code everyday, so be sure to run the "pull script" at the beginning of every class!

## Layout

This repo will have a folder for each day of class with the code you'll need that day.
In the folder, you'll also find a file that outlines what we'll learn that day, the daily objectives, and any tips or hints that may help you along the way.
